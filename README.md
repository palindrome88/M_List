## NSS Capstone Project


I started this project after thinking deeply about my experiences on Tumblr. People ruminate online about all sorts of things, but I didnâ€™t see an engaging way beyond YouTube videos to content that was inspired by critical thinkers, like essayists or critics. Critical analysis could be curated for people who enjoy it.

### Primary Users

My primary user is John. He is about 26 to 31 years old, likes going to the movies, often reads movie reviews before he commits to any particular film, and wants a way to publish his own personal reviews.

### Research Plan

Interviews were conducted with two individuals within the prescribed age range, based on expressed love of film and interest in critiques. After a rough measure of scope was determined, a survey of 7 more individuals were conducted. Those interviews were to delineate the patterns of interaction between people of similar interests. 


### Themes & Insights

* Theme: I want a tool to easily share what's on my mind about a particular film.

* Theme: I want to relate to a critique based on the subject, creators, or some other aspect of the film rather than the film in general.

### Challenge Statement

How might I make a platform for film critics and readers that satisfies artistic expression and values reading pleasure?

### Features

* User authentication through Google using Firebase
* Site to post film reviews to and to store for later review.
